\title{Generate Correlated Set Membership Data}
\usage{
generate_correlated_sets(
  n = 1000,
  x = 5,
  p = rep(0.3, x),
  rho = 0.5,
  multi_prob = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The total number of elements to distribute across sets.}

\item{x}{Integer. The number of sets.}

\item{p}{Numeric vector of length \code{x}. The marginal probability of each element being in a given set.}

\item{rho}{Numeric. The correlation between sets (higher means more overlap).}

\item{multi_prob}{Numeric vector. Probability distribution for assigning "None" elements to 1, 2, or 3 sets.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{counts}{A named numeric vector of set intersections, formatted for eulerr.}
\item{membership_matrix}{A logical matrix (n by x), indicating set membership.}
}
\description{
Simulates set memberships using a correlated Bernoulli approach,
ensuring that every element belongs to at least one set. Returns both the Euler-compatible
counts and the logical membership matrix.
