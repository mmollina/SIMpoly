\title{Plot Parent Phase with ggplot2 (Flipped and Padded)}
\usage{
plot_parent_phase_gg(
  parent.phase,
  colors = c("white", "black"),
  na.value = "grey90"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent.phase}{A named list of binary matrices. Each matrix should have markers
in rows and haplotypes in columns.}

\item{colors}{A character vector of two colors for the binary values (default: c("white", "black")).
The NA fill (for padded cells) is drawn with the na.value color.}

\item{na.value}{Color for missing cells (default: "grey90").}
}
\value{
A ggplot object is printed.
}
\description{
This function takes a named list of binary matrices (each representing a parent)
and produces a ggplot2 tile plot where:
\itemize{
\item The matrices are padded to have four columns (extra columns are filled with NA)
\item The axes are flipped relative to the original matrix (markers are on the x-axis,
haplotypes on the y-axis)
\item Each parent's data is shown in its own row (using facet_grid)
}
}
