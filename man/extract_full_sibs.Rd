\title{Extract Full Sibling Groups}
\usage{
extract_full_sibs(pedigree)
}
\arguments{
\item{pedigree}{A data frame or matrix where columns represent Parent 1, Parent 2, and Offspring. If founders have no parents, they should be represented with NA values.}
}
\value{
A named list where each entry represents a full sibling group, named after the parent pair (or 'Founders' if both parents are NA).
The elements of the list are vectors containing the IDs of the offspring that belong to each sibling group.
}
\description{
This function extracts full sibling groups from a given pedigree matrix. Full siblings are defined as individuals
sharing the same parents.
}
\examples{
# Define a simple pedigree matrix
pedigree <- data.frame(
  Parent1 = c(NA, NA, "F1", "F1", "O1"),
  Parent2 = c(NA, NA, "F2", "F2", "F3"),
  Offspring = c("F1", "F2", "O1", "O2", "O3")
)

# Extract full sibling groups
extract_full_sibs(pedigree)

}
